# Working 9 to 5 #

CS50's Regular Expression Problem Set 7 Working 9 to 5.

Implement a function called convert that expects a str in any of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.
